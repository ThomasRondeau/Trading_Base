"""
Broker contract shared by the simulated broker (backtest) and the IBKR broker (paper / live).

Brokers report executions and terminal statuses through the handlers set by the `OrderRouter`.
A live broker may call them from its network thread: the runner then queues them and processes
them on the strategy thread (see `StrategyRunner`).
